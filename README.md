# Phonemic

Author: Sasha Mishkin

A brief apology: I would have wanted this game to have so much more elements that actually make it interesting to play (wugs that move around the field, fun effects when they're fed the correct vowel, more vowels, prevengting the camera from moving through the floor, etc), but I did not manage to implement any of those things in time. This week did a number on my energy levels.

Design: This is a game intended to help familiarize oneself with vowel symbols in the IPA. The scene features five wugs, each of whom prefers to be fed a different vowel. The wug calls out the vowel sound when selected, and the player must choose which vowel to feed to said wug. (If you've heard of m&m's, you might also enjoy Ə&Ə's!)

How To Play:

Use arrow keys to move the camera, and the mouse position to rotate it. Use "w" to switch which wug is selected (the selected wug will look at the camera). Use "v" to switch which vowel you are holding. Press spacebar to throw the selected vowel at the selected wug. Correctly fed vowels will play a rising "ping" sound, and incorrect ones are denoted with a falling ping.

This game was built with [NEST](NEST.md).
